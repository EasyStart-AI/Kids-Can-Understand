# How are "Weights" Mapped on Analog Tiles?

## PCM techniques
- SET/RESET mechanism*[1]*
    + PCM is actually based on phase change materials, which could change the state between amorphous and crystalline.
    + *RESET*: The procedure of RESET is applying a high voltage to melt the material (from crystalline into amorphous state) and quickly cool down, which could freeze the atomic structure in amorphous state.
    + *SET*: After the cell is amorphized, a voltage which has a lower magnitude but long pulse time is applied to transfer the cell from amorphous state into crystalline state **continuously**.

- Application in CIM *[1,2]*
    + Multi-level programming
        + The following paper *[3,4,5,6,7]* consider the conductance of PCM cell to be continuous and unlimited, which means, one could achieve theoretical unlimited weight precision with an addable noise (deviation, Gaussian noise in short term). 
        ![](./figures/weight_pre.png)
        + Physical research propose*[1]* that the highest reliable precision per single cell is no more than 3bit.  
        
    + Bit slicing
        + Several works would apply bit slicing technique to limit the precision of per column in
