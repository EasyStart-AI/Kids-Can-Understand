## Computing in Memory (CIM)

The memory wall has become increasingly serious with the development of large models. CIM has already become an alternative solution for this problem.

Typically, CIM has two categories: *Digital CIM* and *Analog CIM*. The two types will be introduced separately.

### Analog CIM

Analog CIM is a prevalent research area in AI acceleration. Most analog AI applies Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) to store data. Actually several analog AI works like digital ones with bit wise computing. Others may use continuous conductance of NVM cells. We could dive into this area step by step.
